# MintedWithLovelace-smithy
MintedWithLovelace "smithy" with tools for Cardano NFT (CNFT) prep work, JSON prep, etc

Utilities added:
- Simple find/replace/rename which will rename JSON files within a folder, sans any space or #, and replace given placeholders for asset and display names within.
- Simple file renamer to remove spaces and # from all filenames within a folder.
- Custom 'files' and 'mediaType' removal for JSON files produced with "baggage" code unneeded for Cardano metadata.
